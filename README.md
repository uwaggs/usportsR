`usportsR` is a package that is designed to provide users with data from
all U SPORTS sanctioned sports.

- The package contains U SPORTS data spanning over a decade of
  pre-season, regular season, and post-season matches.

- Sports currently included are Soccer, Basketball, Ice Hockey, Field
  Hockey, Track and Field Field Hockey, Football, Wrestling, Swimming
  and Rugby

- We currently provide access to box score, play-by-play, schedules and
  rankings data

## Installation

You can install the development version of usportsR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("uwaggs/usportsR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(usportsR)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
## basic example to find number of 40+ point games in the last decade

mens_40_pt_games <- mens_player_box_scores %>% filter(pts >= 40)
head(mens_40_pt_games,10)
